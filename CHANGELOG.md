# [0.3.0] - 05/03/2024
- Propagate `region` variable down to query job
- Add `proxy` setting for cases when it is required


# [0.2.0] - 09/06/2023
- Add `@run_time` named parameter (I need this one for my projects)
    - This way we can have dynamic time, which could be useful if executing query at schedule or in some other use-cases


# [0.1.0] - 08/06/2023
- Created initial version of the plugin
    - Can do simple searches, but lots of things are not settled yet
